# SimpleQuadraticVotingMachine
It's a simple quadratic voting machine which needs to be improved. Feel free to help.

I want to make a nice implementation of quadratic voting to get a bead of people's priorities in terms of what they actually value in life so we can have more appropriate goals as we strive for widespread prosperity within planetary boundaries.

I've started. Next steps:

* Make the code better, more object orientated etc.
* Make it look nicer.
* Make it so one can easily add different categores
* get some graphical output.
* figure out what suitable categories are.

Let me know if you'd like to help.
J.
